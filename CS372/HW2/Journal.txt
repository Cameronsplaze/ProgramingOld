Journal for Test Driven Development on HW2 for CS372

1. Went to one of my old programs from 311 and deleted almost everything inside
but the minimal framework for catch.h, renamed everything, and got it to compile
using command line: "g++ -std=c++11 -o compileMe cs372hw2_test.cpp cs372hw2.cpp"

2. failed first test which was calling a function that returned true, and seeing
if it equaled false.

3. added first two real tests: strings of "", and "2". program only returns 0.
Made program pass both tests, but only works on single ints.()

4. changed it so it takes as many single ints as possible, and then added the 
while loop to make each number as long as possible. since im not checking what the
delimiter is, i automatically passed all the \n tests

5. added delimiter support. bassically if the first chars in the string are //, 
delete first 4 chars and continue

Note: im assuming that delimiters can not be ints, and can only be one char length,
	because increasing the length is #7 on the optional list.
	Would be easy to add tho, just save the length and what the delimiter is,
	and at the bottom of the main for loop, check for it. if its there, i+=delimiter
	lenght, else jump the default ++i that is there now.

6. added negaive support. was a lot easier than i expected. i put the negative in a 
vector, and dont add it to returnMe. at the end, if there is anything in the vector,
that means the string contained a negative, and i print the error message along with 
the error
