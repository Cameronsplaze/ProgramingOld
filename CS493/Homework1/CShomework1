Password 1:
	Just opened the file in gedit. Looks like the password is "nuB?",
	but it could be Lawl. 

Password 2:
	After giving up on hashcat and getting john to work, ran the commands
	on your lecture notes, and "$tFu". Lecture notes say to use --format=Raw-SHA1,
	I couldn't get it to work unless I used --format=Raw-SHA256.


Password 3:
	Opened file in Bless, copied the hex into gedit, and deleted the spaces.
	Made sure there was no new line, Ran that through John, and got "r0FL"
